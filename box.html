    <h3>U.S. Job Market Box Plot: Salary Distributions Across Experience Levels (2023-2024)</h3>
    <p3>
        This box plot explores how salary distributions vary by experience level,
      revealing both central trends and spread across roles. Median salaries increase steadily from Internship to Executive roles,
      with significantly higher salary variability at senior levels like Director and Executive, reflecting broader compensation ranges.
      Notably, the consistency in mid-level roles contrasts sharply with the high dispersion among leadership roles,
      hinting at factors like industry, company size, or negotiation influencing top-end salaries.

    <h4>Takeaways</h4>
    <p3>
      This visualization shows the clear upward trajectory of salary ranges for people as they  gain more experience throughout their career, with median compensation increases from around $60K for interns to around $200K for executive roles. While entry-level and mid-level roles show relatively tight salary ranges, more senior roles like Director and Executive are observed to have much wider distributions. This may be because other factors (e.g. company scale, industry, equity compensation, and individual negotiation) play a larger role for positions that require more experience. The sharp increase in the range/variability for positions requiring more experience reveal the possibility for significantly greater salaries with greater uncertainty in people's late career.
