      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p3>
        Through our examination of LinkedIn job postings from 2023-2024, we were able to draw valuable insights into the factors influencing job salaries across the United States. We cleaned and prepared over 124,000 job listings, to create a dataset of 9,545 datapoints focused on full-time positions with yearly USD salaries. We presented our findings on the relationships between compensation and various factors including geographic location, experience level, industry sector, required skills, and job engagement metrics through different visualizations.
        Geographic analysis reveals significant salary disparities across the United States, with coastal states like California, Washington, and New York having substantially higher average compensations. This is likely due to their concentration of urban cities and industry hubs in technology, finance, and aerospace causing a higher cost of living. The county level visualization further identifies more local economic hotspots within more moderate salary regions. As expected, pay increases with experience, with interns making around $60K while executives earn about $200K on average.
        Higher-level jobs also show much wider salary ranges. We can see that while entry and mid-level positions show relatively narrow salary ranges, director and executive roles display significantly wider distributions, suggesting that factors like industry, company size, and individual negotiation play increasingly important roles at senior levels.
        <br><br> The research also looked at how many people view and apply to jobs. While higher-paying jobs usually get more attention, this isn't always true. Some job listings offering a $300K+ salary don't attract any more interest than lower-paying ones. There are regional differences too, with Northeast jobs getting lots of applications even at lower salaries.
        When looking at industries, Manufacturing is the most diverse with over 40 sub-industries and salaries from $60K to $220K. Financial Services has fewer sub-industries but they pay more, and Technology includes some of the highest-paying roles above $260K. This comprehensive analysis demonstrates that job market compensation follows complex patterns influenced by geographic location,
        required experience, industry specialization, and skill demands rather than any single factor. Future research could extend this work through time-series analysis tracking salary evolution, incorporation of additional variables like company size, examination of economic event impacts on hiring patterns, analysis of educational requirements and compensation relationships, or development of predictive models forecasting salary ranges based on combinations of job attributes and market conditions. These would allow us to see further insights on compensation of jobs.
