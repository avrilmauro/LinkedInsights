    <h3>U.S. Job Market Map: Salary, Sector, and Skills by State and County (2023–2024)</h3>
    <p3>
      This interactive map displays U.S. job market data from LinkedIn job postings (2023–2024) with two layers: state-level and county-level, which can be toggled using the control in the top-right corner. Regions are shaded by average salary, highlighting geographic disparities, with additional details available when hovering or clicking on a region. Clicking on a region brings up a richer popup with additional insights, including the median salary, total number of job postings, the top hiring sector, the percentage of jobs in that sector, and the top three most common skills found in job listings from that area. This tool enables users to explore spatial trends in compensation, industry dominance, and skill demand across the country.

    <h4>Takeaways</h4>
    <p3>
      This map highlights geographic disparities in job compensation across the United States, which reveals how average salaries vary depending on both state and county. Higher salaries tend to cluster around coastal states like California, Washington, and New York, while many central and southern states show more moderate wage levels. This is likely the case because of how there is a greater concentration of high-cost urban centers and industry hubs (such as tech in Silicon Valley, finance in New York City, and aerospace in Seattle) that significantly drive up both wages and living expenses in these coastal regions. On the other end, the county-level view reveals areas of high-paying areas within lower-paying states, which shows the presence of local economic hubs.
