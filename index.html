            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p2>The job market today is constantly changing, and understanding hiring trends can help both the job seekers and employers make better decisions.
                The project that we are doing analyzes a dataset of LinkedIn job postings from 2023 to 2024 to explore trends in job availability, industry demand,
                required skills, and hiring locations. As we observe shifts in the economy, new technologies, and the rise of remote work since the pandemic,
                itâ€™s more important than ever to see how opportunities are evolving. By creating effective and informative visualizations of these trends,
                we hope to give students like us, professionals, and businesses useful insights and views into what the job market looks like today
                and where it might be headed. NOTE: THIS IS NOT THE FINAL TEXT. THIS IS JUST A PLACEHOLDER FROM THE PROPOSAL.
