    <h3>U.S. Job Market Bar Plot: Top 5 Skills Across Salary Ranges (2023-2024)</h3>
    <p3>
      This stacked bar chart shows the frequency of some top skills across different salary buckets. Taking a look at the skills individually, Information Technology and Sales has representation in all of the salary ranges. Information Technology does have the greatest appearance in jobs within the $110k-$150k bucket with 683 occurrences. Sales tends to dominate the lower salary ranges and becomes smaller as pay increases. Administrative and Accounting work is concentrated in the lower ranges, while Finance, Management, and Engineering is concentrated in the higher ranges. Something interesting to note is the exclusion of Health Care Provider skills until the $200k+ range, suggesting this is a highly specialized, and therefore compensated, role. Overall in the higher salary range, we find that the required skills are highly specialized and technical. While in the lower ranges, we find jobs that are more related to administration and sales. We can also see how some skills slowly build up to higher paying roles, potentially signifying career progression. For job seekers, this visualization offers strategic guidance for skill development pathways and career progression, highlighting how certain competencies may unlock higher earning potential. For employers, these insights can be leveraged to structure competitive compensation packages aligned with market-validated skill valuations.

    <h4>Takeaways</h4>
    <p3>
      This visualization shows the clear upward trajectory of salary ranges for people as they  gain more experience throughout their career, with median compensation increases from around $60K for interns to around $200K for executive roles. While entry-level and mid-level roles show relatively tight salary ranges, more senior roles like Director and Executive are observed to have much wider distributions. This may be because other factors (e.g. company scale, industry, equity compensation, and individual negotiation) play a larger role for positions that require more experience. The sharp increase in the range/variability for positions requiring more experience reveal the possibility for significantly greater salaries with greater uncertainty in people's late career.
